## Buy & Sell Gold

An App that retrieves 'price list' for golds with their prices on different days,
the challenge is to find the lowest price to buy the gold and sell it with a higher price AFTER the buying day.


Change the number of `RANDOM_SEED_STATE` in API 
to generate different sequences of numbers to test the code with different price list
with different days.

### Run the code
cd into the project root folder where pom.xml resides.
run:
`mvn clean install`

run:
`java -jar target/buy-sell-gold-0.1.jar`
